# im not gonna lie to you
#### this project was probably too much to ask of me this week. 
#### but here i am, submitting. I know that my code could be cleaner,
#### i know that there are a few things id like to improve.
#### i would prefere to submit a functional, if imperfect product "on time" (okay, just over an hour past the deadline,) than submit a more refined product LATE.
#### 
#### I will continue to refine this and hope that i may submit an improved version for code review if not for grading. Thanks for reading my ramble.
###
## in the meantime:
####   - this projects .JSON includes cookieParser which i have phased out in functionality. you do not need it. 
####   - many of my bits of test data may have residual silly values. I had to stay sane. you may find many butts. 
####   - i am writing this README at 2:13 am, december first, 2023. I have an exam in 9 hours so i will now submit this project and get as much sleep as i can. 
####   - i have only just remembered that i have a dark mode extension on chrome. Please do not be alarmed by differing colours, i just have sensitive eyes. If this assignment included CSS website designing, you could also have a dark UI. 
#### 
#### cheers, and godspeed.
