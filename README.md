im not gonna lie to you
this project was probably too much to ask this week.
our entire cohort is behind by at least a day. 
im the only one remotely close to submitting.
but here i am, submitting. I know that my code could be cleaner,
i know that there are a few things id like to improve.
i would prefere to submit a functional, if imperfect product "on time" 
(okay, just over an hour past the deadline,) than submit a more refined product LATE.

I will continue to refine this and hope that i may submit an improved version for code review
if not for grading. Thanks for reading my ramble.

in the meantime:
  - this projects .JSON includes cookieParser which i have phased out in functionality. you do 
    not need it. 
  - many of my bits of test data may have residual silly values. I had to stay sane.
    you may find many butts. 
  - i am writing this README at 2:13 am, december first, 2023. I have an exam in 9 hours so 
    i will now submit this project and get as much sleep as i can. 

    -godspeed.
